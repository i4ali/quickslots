**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025
**Document Owner:** Product Team

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
QuickSlots is a temporary scheduling link service that allows users to instantly create shareable availability links without creating an account or connecting a calendar. Think "one minute email" but for scheduling.

### 1.2 Value Proposition
- **For Users:** Share your availability in seconds without the hassle of calendar apps, account creation, or ongoing commitments
- **For the Business:** High-traffic, ad-supported service with viral growth potential through organic sharing

### 1.3 Business Model
Free service monetized through:
1. **Display advertising:** Minimal, tasteful ads (header/footer banners) that don't interfere with UX
2. **Optional tips/donations:** Users can support the service voluntarily (tips do NOT remove ads or unlock features)

Focus on high traffic volume, good user experience, and SEO optimization.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Pain Points
1. **Overkill solutions:** Calendly, Cal.com require account creation for one-time scheduling needs
2. **Calendar privacy:** Users don't want to expose their real calendar or connect third-party apps
3. **Casual use cases:** "Coffee next week?" doesn't need enterprise scheduling software
4. **Time investment:** Setting up scheduling tools takes longer than just scheduling the meeting
5. **Spam concerns:** Don't want permanent scheduling links floating around the internet

### 2.2 Market Opportunity
- Millions of one-off scheduling needs daily (freelancers, job interviews, casual meetings, coffee chats)
- Success of temporary services (temp email, temp SMS) proves demand for disposable digital tools
- SEO opportunity for "temporary scheduling" and related keywords

---

- No traditional database needed (data auto-expires)

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/slots/create
  - Input: creator_name, creator_email, meeting_purpose,
           time_slots[], timezone, expiration
  - Output: slot ID, shareable link, management token

GET /api/slots/:id

```

### 7.2A Natural Language Date Processing

**Library:** chrono-node (https://github.com/wanasit/chrono)

**How It Works:**
Chrono-node parses natural language text and extracts date/time information, returning structured date objects.

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
import * as chrono from 'chrono-node';

// Parse single date/time
const result = chrono.parse('tomorrow at 3pm');
// Returns: [{ start: { date: Date }, text: 'tomorrow at 3pm' }]

// Parse date range (start and end)
const rangeResult = chrono.parse('Tuesday, Oct 8 - 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM');
// Returns: [{ start: { date: Date }, end: { date: Date }, text: '...' }]

// Parse simple range
const simpleRange = chrono.parse('Friday 10am-12pm');
// Returns: [{ start: { date: Date }, end: { date: Date } }]
```

**Supported Input Formats:**
- **Explicit dates with times:** "Tuesday, Oct 8 - 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM"
- **Relative dates:** "tomorrow at 3pm", "next Friday 2-4pm"
- **Informal ranges:** "Friday 10am-12pm", "this Tuesday from 2 to 4"
- **Date + time:** "October 10 at 2pm", "10/10 3:00 PM"
- **Multi-language support:** English, Japanese, French, Dutch, Russian, Ukrainian (partial: German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Client-side Parsing:**
   - User types natural language input in text field
   - On blur or button press, parse with chrono-node
   - Display interpreted date/time for user confirmation
   - Show error if parsing fails or returns ambiguous results

2. **Validation Rules:**
   - Must parse to valid date object
   - Start time must be before end time
   - Date/time must be in the future (no past dates)
   - If only start time provided, default end to 1 hour later
   - Maximum 5 slots per link

3. **UX Flow:**
   ```
   User types: "tomorrow 3-5pm"
   ‚Üí Parse with chrono-node
   ‚Üí Display: "‚úì Wednesday, Oct 9, 2025 - 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (EDT)"
   ‚Üí User confirms or edits
   ‚Üí Add to slot list
   ```

4. **Error Handling:**
   - **Unparseable input:** Show helpful message: "Try: 'tomorrow at 2pm' or 'Friday 10am-12pm'"
   - **Ambiguous dates:** Prompt for clarification
   - **Past dates:** "Please enter a future date/time"
   - **Invalid range:** "Start time must be before end time"

5. **Fallback Options:**
   - Provide example inputs below text field
   - "Try: 'tomorrow at 2pm', 'next Friday 10am-12pm', 'Oct 15 at 3pm'"
   - Allow manual editing of parsed result if needed

6. **Storage Format:**
   Store parsed dates as UTC timestamps in Redis:
   ```javascript
   {
     "time_slots": [
       {
         "start": "2025-10-09T19:00:00.000Z",  // UTC timestamp
         "end": "2025-10-09T21:00:00.000Z",    // UTC timestamp
         "raw_input": "tomorrow 3-5pm"         // Original user input
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Advantages Over Traditional Date Pickers:**
- ‚úÖ Faster input (typing vs. clicking through calendars)
- ‚úÖ More natural/intuitive ("tomorrow at 3" vs. selecting date + time)
- ‚úÖ Better mobile experience (no complex picker UI)
- ‚úÖ Flexible input formats
- ‚úÖ Handles ranges naturally ("2-4pm" in one input)

**Package Information:**
- **NPM:** `chrono-node`
- **Size:** ~150KB (minified)
- **License:** MIT
- **Maintenance:** Actively maintained (2025)

### 7.3 Redis Data Structure

Using **Upstash Redis** with built-in TTL (Time-To-Live) for automatic data expiration.

**Key Pattern: `slot:{id}`**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "created_at": 1696800000,
  "expires_at": 1696972800,
  "creator_name": "Sarah Chen",
  "creator_email": "sarah@email.com",
  "meeting_purpose": "Coffee chat",
  "time_slots": [
    {"date": "2025-10-08", "start_time": "14:00", "end_time": "16:00"},
    {"date": "2025-10-09", "start_time": "10:00", "end_time": "12:00"}
  ],
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "status": "active"
}

TTL: 86400 seconds (24 hours) - AUTO-EXPIRES
```

**Key Pattern: `booking:{slot_id}`**
```json
{
  "slot_id": "abc123",
  "booked_at": 1696850000,
  "booker_name": "Alex Rodriguez",
  "booker_email": "alex@email.com",
  "booker_note": "Looking forward to meeting!",
  "selected_time": "2025-10-09T10:00:00",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
}

TTL: Same as parent slot - AUTO-EXPIRES
```

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis'

const redis = Redis.fromEnv()

// Create slot with 24hr auto-expiration
await redis.set(`slot:${id}`, slotData, { ex: 86400 })

// Get slot
const slot = await redis.get(`slot:${id}`)

// Data automatically deleted after 24 hours - no cleanup job needed!
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Built-in auto-expiration (no manual cleanup jobs)
- ‚úÖ Simple key-value operations (fast)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for temporary data
- ‚úÖ Serverless-friendly
- ‚úÖ No PII persists beyond TTL

### 7.4 Infrastructure
**Hosting:**
- **Vercel** for full-stack Next.js deployment (includes global CDN)

**Data Storage:**
- **Upstash Redis** (serverless Redis with built-in TTL)
  - Free tier: 256MB storage, 500K commands/month
  - Pay-as-you-go: $0.20 per 100K requests after free tier
  - Global edge locations for low latency
  - No server management required

**Services:**
- Email: SendGrid for confirmation emails
- Payments: Stripe/PayPal for tip processing

**Scalability:**
- Serverless functions auto-scale (Vercel)
- Upstash Redis auto-scales globally
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (10 links/hour per IP)
- No database replicas needed (Redis is fast and serverless)

### 7.5 Email Templates
**Booking Confirmation (to booker):**
```

You've successfully booked a slot!

Meeting Details:
- Date & Time: [Parsed Time in Recipient Timezone]
